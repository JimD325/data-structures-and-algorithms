## Learning Objectives

### Data Structure: Stacks & Queues

Arrays allow quick random access. Linked Lists enforce first/next. Stacks and
Queues encode traversal and structure together.

- Stacks: Last In (push), First Out (pop) (peek)
- Queues: First In (enqueue), First Out, (dequeue) (peek)
- JS Array: push, pop, shift, unshift, [0], [length - 1]

* Document
* Test

## Challenge
The challenge was to implement methods in the stack and queue. These methods were push, pop, enqueue, dequeue, peek, and size.

## API
- Peek is available for both stacks and queues. It will tell the user the value of the element in the first position in the stack/queue. 
- Size is available for both, and will let the user know the number of items in the stack or queue.
- pop and dequeue are available for stacks and queues, respectfully. In both cases they remove the element which was most recently added to the stack/queue. 
- push and enqueue are available for stacks and queues respectfully. In both cases they add an element at the end of the stack/queue.
