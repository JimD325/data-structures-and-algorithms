Challenge Setup & Execution
Branch Name: trees

Challenge Type: New Implementation

Features
Node
Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node.
Binary Tree
Create a Binary Tree class
Define a method for each of the depth first traversals:
pre order
in order
post order which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.
Binary Search Tree
Create a Binary Search Tree class
This class should be a sub-class (or your languages equivalent) of the Binary Tree Class, with the following additional methods:
Add
Arguments: value
Return: nothing
Adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.
Contains
Argument: value
Returns: boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.
Structure and Testing
Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

Be sure to follow your language/frameworks standard naming conventions (e.g. C# uses PascalCasing for all method and class names).

Any exceptions or errors that come from your code should be contextual, descriptive, capture-able errors. For example, rather than a default error thrown by your language, your code should raise/throw a custom error that describes what went wrong in calling the methods you wrote for this lab.

Write tests to prove the following functionality:

Can successfully instantiate an empty tree
Can successfully instantiate a tree with a single root node
For a Binary Search Tree, can successfully add a left child and right child properly to a node
Can successfully return a collection from a preorder traversal
Can successfully return a collection from an inorder traversal
Can successfully return a collection from a postorder traversal
Returns true|false for the contains method, given an existing or non-existing node value
Ensure your tests are passing before you submit your solution.

Stretch Goal
Create a new branch called k-ary-tree, and, using the resources available to you online, implement a k-ary tree, where each node can have any number of children.
